# Trident Ready Performance Statistics

Trident Ready Performance Statistics is a custom analytics package that is importable in the RAGE Analytics Realtime famework by UCM: https://github.com/e-ucm/rage-analytics-realtime.

Development is focussed on implementing the performance statistics asset (found here: https://github.com/rageappliedgame/PerformanceStatisticsAsset) as custom analytics in the UCM framework. The system correctly queries and updates mongoDB for the gameplay trace data needed for the statistics. Currently, the statistical algorythms for calculating group performance per trial are being integrated.
